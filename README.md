## Resource-Aware Scheduling on HeterogeneousServer with Convex Optimization
### Author: Simon Wong, Linus Wong

**Abstract:** With growing demands for resource-demanding jobs in different technologies like Deep Learning, Big Data and Internetof Things, job scheduling in the heterogeneous server are rapidly being adopted. To ensure jobs are completed within thegiven deadline, different servers need to be standby to ensure the jobs which fit the provided environment can be solvedtimely. However, maintaining heterogeneous servers to support a considerable variety of types of jobs is resource exhaustive.Optimizing the resource consumption, significantly reducing the maximum flowtime, and maintaining the systems’ reliabilityis  essential  to  catalyze  a  generic  adoption  of  job  scheduling  in  the  heterogeneous  server  in  more  businesses  and  real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a formula that can be convex optimized to minimize the maximum flowtime ofthe servers with known jobs, thereby reducing the overall resource consumption. Furthermore, our paper investigates theperformance variation when our proposed formula is applied in a single server, multiple servers, and a heterogeneous serverscenario. To prove the proposed formulation’s performance, we have experimented with a computer simulation comparingsome typical benchmarks to demonstrate that we could reduce the maximum flowtime while retaining the reliability.
